# WooCommerce Free Gift Coupons
## Allow customers to select options for variable products that are free gifts

### What's This?

Experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Free Gift Coupons](https://woocommerce.com/products/free-gift-coupons//) that adds a link in the cart for customers to go back to a product page and select attributes for a variable product.

A perfect use case for this would be using a Free Gift Coupon to give away a free t-shirt with purchase, while allowing the customer to choose their size/color/etc.

Clicking this link takes the customer to the single product page, where they can make their selections. The normal "Add to cart" button is replaced by an "Update Gift" which brings the customer back to the cart, with the free gift product being updated to their chosen variation.
